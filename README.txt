TESTED On the given test case and some additional test cases
Various available functions include-
Add Node: Integrates a new node into the DHT, establishing its position and connections.
Remove Node: Safely extracts a node from the network, redistributing keys and updating connections.
Insert Key: Places a key-value pair into the network, storing it in the appropriate node.
Delete Key: Eliminates a specified key from the network, removing it from its storing node.
Key Lookup: Retrieves the value for a given key by navigating through the network.
Print Finger Tables: Visualizes the routing information of each node in a tabular format.
Print Stored Keys: Displays the keys held by each node in the network.
